    generate_network(SR::Int, SC::Int)

return matrix W[i,j], which is nonzero if consumer i eats resource j
SR is the number of resource, SC the number of consumer species.

The bipartite network is generated as follows. 
First, both resources and consumers are labeled consecutively, 
based on their initial temperature adaptations: 
resource 1 / consumer 1 are the most cold-adapted, 
and resource S / consumer S the most warm-adapted. 
Next, we always put a feeding link between consumer i and resource i. 
Finally, each consumer is randomly linked to four other resource species. 
This yields a feeding network where every consumer is 
connected to five resources altogether.

Note: it seems that the definition of W_ij is that it determines which resource i is eat by consumer j
