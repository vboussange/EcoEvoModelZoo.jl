First, both resources and consumers are labeled consecutively,  based on their initial temperature adaptations:  resource 1 / consumer 1 are the most cold-adapted,  and resource S / consumer S the most warm-adapted.  Next, we always put a feeding link between consumer i and resource i.  Finally, each consumer is randomly linked to four other resource species.  This yields a feeding network where every consumer is  connected to five resources altogether.\n\nNote: it seems that the definition of W_ij is that it determines which resource i is eat by consumer j\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#EcoEvoModelZoo.init_params_akesson_model-Union{Tuple{Tr}, Tuple{CP}, Tuple{WG}, Tuple{Landscape, Temperature, Any, Any}} where {WG, CP, Tr}","page":"Home","title":"EcoEvoModelZoo.init_params_akesson_model","text":"init_params_akesson_model(\n    land,\n    temp,\n    SR,\n    SC;\n    width_growth,\n    competition,\n    trophic,\n    vbar,\n    dbar,\n    kappa,\n    eta,\n    nmin,\n    aw,\n    bw,\n    w\n)\n\n\nReturns a Dictionary with all biological parameters for Akesson model.\n\nArguments\n\nmodel_type: can take values \"normal\", \"Tdep\", \"Tdep_trophic\" and \"trophic\".\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#EcoEvoModelZoo.smoothstep-Tuple{Any}","page":"Home","title":"EcoEvoModelZoo.smoothstep","text":"Apply twice continuously differentiable smoothed step function to a number x Input: x: Distance from pole, measured in units of the pole-to-equator distance Output: 0 if x < 0; 10x^3-15x^4+6*x^5 if 0 <= x <= 1; otherwise 1\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
